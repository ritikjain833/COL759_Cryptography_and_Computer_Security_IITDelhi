Encryption
How to run:
1. Open the file encrypt.py
2. Run the code (python encrypt.py) then enter
3.Enter the file name of plain text  i.e. input1.txt or Plain.txt then enter
4.Enter location of the file to get encrypted text: encrypt.txt  then enter
5.Enter the location of key like key21.txt  then enter

6. cipher text is generated  in encrpyt.txt


Decryption
How to run:
1. Open  the file decrypt.py
2. Run the code (python decrypt.py) then enter
3. Enter location of the file containing encrypted text: i.e. encrpyt.txt then enter
4.Enter location of the file to get decrypted text: decrypt.txt  then enter
5.Enter the location of key like key21.txt  then enter

6. Plain text is generated  in decrypt.txt

Crpytanalysis
How to run:
1. Open the file Crpytanalysis.py
2. Run the code (python cryptanalysis.py) then enter
3.Enter location of the file containing plain text: input2.txt then enter
4. Enter location of the file to get encrypted text: cipher.txt then enter
5. Output is printed along with the correct key 

Note: key is given on a single line in the keyfiles(e.g. key21.txt) seperated by space.
